# Data-Science-Project-Rshiny-app
I prepared a shinyapp of my project, Excepting some changes.

I made predicitions for the dataset permanent magnet synchronus motor dataset to get the best accuracy model.

It is continous dataset.

Prepared models with required algorithms both in R and Python.

I'm not able to add csv file for your reference because of the file size. The file size is 120 mb. Github is not allowing the files contains with higher size.
